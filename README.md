# Language Matters

Exploring how to support more than one locale in an app. 

This is a work in progress.


### Disclaimer

I only really speak English (Australian) and some Bahasa Indonesia. I am relying on google translate for any other languages, so it may not quite make sense or I may use the wrong words.
